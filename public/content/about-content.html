      I'm fascinated by the interface design problems faced by emerging technologies -- problems where the user behaviors and the norms that typically
      constrain a solution space aren't well-defined yet. Where “what you choose to design” is almost as important as “how you design it.”

      <!-- I focus on behavior change and product strategy in interface design -- problems where
      "What, exactly, is broken?" is about as unclear as "How should we fix it?"

      As a designer with a math background, I've worked

      - I do a lot (IA, dataviz, maps, motion, technical prototyping, design systems, UXR, some 3D)
      - Product strategy - I've focused on problems where "What, exactly, is broken?" is about as unclear as "How should we fix it?"
      - I'm fascinated by emerging technologies where behaviors are not as defined, as well as problem areas with physical/real-world stakes
      - I find the math background - the ability to model or build - has outsize value here

      And as a product designer with a math background, I try to go beyond the bounds of conventional design efforts to solve those problems. 
      About half my work is interface design -- information architecture, design systems, technical prototyping, usability testing -- 
      and half is other stuff like building my own tooling, combing through experiment data, leading cross-functional teams, and so on.


        <!-- About half my work is exploring that first question -- leading groups, modeling problems quantitatively, exploring new ideas quickly in code,
        half is actual user interface.
        About half my work 

        - Broad experience
        - Spike in product strategy
        - Interested in emerging technologies, real-world stakes
        - Quantitative guy
        
        Especially ones involving emerging technologies or real-world stakes -- where the ability to model a problem quantitatively,
        or explore a new idea quickly in code, seems to have extra value -- and half is actual user interface design. -->

        From 2017 to 2023, I designed products and led cross-team initiatives for Uber. Before that, I was a Kleiner Perkins Design 
        Fellow (2016). Before that, I worked at VC firms and startup accelerators, wearing hats as an engineer, designer, researcher, 
        and PM. Before that, I studied applied math, computer science, and economics at the University of Chicago. Here's my
