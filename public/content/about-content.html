    As a designer with a math background, I'm fascinated by technical systems mediated by some customer interaction.
</p> 
<p>
    About half my work is designing the mechanics and structure of those interactions, and half is user interface.
</p>
<p>
    From 2017 to 2023, I designed products and led cross-team initiatives for Uber.
</p>
<p>
    Before that, I was a Kleiner Perkins Design Fellow (2016).
</p>
<p>    
    Before that, I worked at VC firms and startup accelerators, wearing hats as an engineer, designer, researcher, and PM.
</p>
<p>
    Before that, I studied math, computer science, and economics at the University of Chicago.
</p>

    Here's my resume.
