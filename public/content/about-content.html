<p>
    As a designer with a math background, I'm fascinated by technologies and systems that provide (or could provide) for public needs.
</p> 
<p>
    About half of my work is designing the mechanics of those systems, and half is user interface.
</p>
<p>
    From 2017 to 2023, I designed products and led cross-team initiatives for Uber.
</p>
<p>
    Before that, I was a Kleiner Perkins Design Fellow (2016).
</p>
<p>    
    Before that, I worked at VC firms and startup accelerators, wearing hats as an engineer, designer, researcher, and PM.
</p>
<p>
    Before that, I studied applied math, computer science, and economics at the University of Chicago.
