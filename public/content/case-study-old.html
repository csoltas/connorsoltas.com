<h1>Technical prototyping with data</h1>
<p>
  In late 2022, I conceived and built a tool for Uber designers to work on cartography and geospatial visualizations in tandem.
</p>
<p>
  That tool helped me lead a redesign of the Uber driver/courier app's most used feature -- the main map -- from the ground up.
</p>
<p>The tooling I built sped up the redesign while improving the quality of every stage of output along the way.</p>

<h2>Why I made this</h2>
<p>
  I was tasked with redesigning the app's main map, which had become a jumbled mess drivers
  found useless.
</p>

<p>
  I wasn't tasked with building a new tool. But I knew one would help me redesign the map 
  better and faster, so I set out to build the simplest sufficient tool for the job.
</p>

<h2>What I made</h2>
<p>
  A tiny web app making it easy for me (and future designers) to prototype new basemap styles & data
  visualizations interactively, at full fidelity, with real Uber data.
</p>

<h2>How it delivered</h2>
<p>
  The new design completely reshaped our main map into a stark canvas for data visualization.
</p>

<p>
  The tooling I built sped up that redesign, while improving the quality of every 
  intermediate stage of output.
</p>

<p>
  This launch is still under development/review at Uber.

<h3>The concept</h3>

<p>
  While I wasn't tasked with building a new tool, I knew it could help me redesign the map better and faster.
</p>

<p>
  So I set out to build the simplest sufficient tool: a tiny web app to prototype map visuals & interaction design, at full 
  fidelity, with real Uber data.
</p>

<hr class="sm">

<h3>Here's what I did</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
      Learned enough <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs" target="_blank">Mapbox GL JS</a> and
      <a href="https://deck.gl/" target="_blank">DeckGL</a> [and a few other libraries] to do the job.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built the web app I needed. Documented a workflow that I taught to others.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used the web app to redesign the map from first principles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Iterated on map design in constant communication with non-map designers and Uber's product execs.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<!-- 
  <p>
    The new design stripped out all distractions from drivers' top intent when they open
    the app: checking potential earnings.
  </p>

  <p>  
    To do this, I heavily curtailed the use of color and contrast.
    I also combined Uber's conflicting earnings proxies into one [<a href="">note</a>].
  </p>

  <p>I delivered...</p> 
-->


<p>
  The new design completely reshaped our main map into a stark canvas for data visualization.
  [See <a href="">other case study</a>]
</p>

<p>
  Moreover the design deliverables were essentially production code -- little effort
  was needed to go from design to deployment.
</p>

<h3>Impact discussion</h3>

<p>
  My team was only able to confidently propose such a radical new direction because we could easily explore 
  all its downstream consequences.
</p>

<p>
  And Uber execs could see those consequences, too -- saving them time that often gets lost in
  slide decks, and enabling conversations that were just too abstract to have beforehand.
</p>

<p>
  This sped up the redesign project while also improving the quality of every intermediate stage of output.
</p>

<hr class="sm">

<p>
  Even further, the tool I built acted as a prototype we could bring directly into user testing, letting us gather
  feedback that only built confidence in our direction.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, the redesign encouraged Uber to launch a unified visualization of potential earnings on the main map.
  [See <a href="">other case study</a>.]
</p>

<!-- <p>
  It also motivated product teams to monitor how pricing changes affected net driver earnings,
  given the new product direction would bring higher scrutiny to it. (We fundamentally believe that scrutiny is
  a good thing, both for Uber and for workers generally.)
