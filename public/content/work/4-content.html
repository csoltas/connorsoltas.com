<h1>What does pricing do for users?</h1>
<p>
  In 2019, the strategy of Uber's Pricing team wasn't landing with drivers. In practice, it was reducing the earnings of 
  those who "played Uber's game" best, undermining their trust.
</p>
<p>
  I brought the Pricing team together to rewrite its mission, then led research to equip them with a clear focus inside that mission.
</p>
<p>
  This work advanced a new understanding of Uber's drivers, and it shapes Uber's roadmap today.

<h2>Developing a broad mission into clear focus areas</h2>
<p>
  Rather than blaming drivers for being strategic, the new mission celebrated them for it. It repositioned
  pricing as Uber's tool to help drivers learn which strategies work.
</p>
<p>
  But this raised new questions. To help drivers learn a strategy, Uber would need to understand how strategy is learned and where
  to intervene.
</p>
<p>
  I proposed and led user research to answer that question.
