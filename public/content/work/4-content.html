    In 2019, the strategy of Uber's Pricing team wasn't landing with drivers. In practice, it was reducing the earnings of those who &#8220;played Uber's game&#8221;
    best, undermining their trust. I brought the Pricing team together to rewrite its mission, then led research to equip them with a clear focus inside 
    that mission. This work advanced a new understanding of Uber's drivers, and it shapes Uber's roadmap today.

    Rather than blaming drivers for being strategic, the new mission celebrated them for it. It repositioned pricing as Uber's tool to help drivers learn
    which strategies work. But this raised new questions. To help drivers learn a strategy, Uber would need to understand how strategy is learned and where
    to intervene. I proposed and led user research to answer that question.
