<h1>Vision-setting and vision-enabling</h1>
<p>
  In 2021, I was one of two designers asked to lead a redesign of Uber's complex and cumbersome driver app.
</p>
<p>
  Despite internal support for our vision, at its core was a map overhaul that Uber was in no position to execute, either organizationally or architecturally.
</p>
<p>
  I proposed and led an initiative across teams to change that.
</p>

<!-- <h2>First, setting the vision...</h2>

<p>
  Since 2018, the driver app's feature set had expanded dramatically, with little attention paid to its overall organization.
</p>

<p>
  Our redesign brought emphasis back to the app's core utility: running a small business behind the wheel of a moving car.
</p>

<p>
  My work drew on existing research and introduced the vision's key frameworks: "Horizontal Growth" and "Vertical Growth" -- creating a shared
  vocabulary for the proposals.
</p>

<h2>A cross-functional initiative to bring it to life</h2>
<p>
  At our vision's core was a stark simplification of the app's main map -- a surface with no clear owner, despite being 75% of the app home screen.
</p>
<p>
  So I became its owner. I brokered conversations between teams with competing short-term incentives, presented to execs, and led those
  teams with a unified plan.
