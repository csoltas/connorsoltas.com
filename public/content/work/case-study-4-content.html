<h1>What does pricing do for users?</h1>
<p>
  In 2019, the strategy of Uber's Pricing team wasn't landing with drivers. In practice, it was reducing the earnings of 
  those who "played Uber's game" best, undermining their trust.
</p>
<p>
  I brought the Pricing team together to rewrite its mission, then led research to equip them with a clear focus inside that mission.
</p>
<p>
  This work advanced a new understanding of Uber's drivers, and it shapes Uber's roadmap today.

<h2>Developing a broad mission into clear focus areas</h2>
<p>
  Rather than blaming drivers for being strategic, the new mission celebrated them for it. It repositioned
  pricing as Uber's tool to help drivers learn which strategies work.
</p>
<p>
  But this raised new questions. To help drivers learn a strategy, Uber would need to understand how strategy is learned and where
  to intervene.
</p>
<p>
  I proposed and led user research to answer that question.

<!-- <h2>A vision based in the research</h2>
<p>
  The research helped Uber see how its driver app had grown cumbersome, with little attention paid to driver's core need to earn quickly and
  then increase their earnings over time.
</p>
<p>
  I was asked to help lead a redesign with 2 other designers.
</p>
<p>
  I drew on our research to inform provocative vision concepts that broke us out of incremental thinking.
</p>
<p>
  I introduced key frameworks for the new design: "Earner Identity," "Storefront," and "Horizontal/Vertical Growth," creating a shared
  vocabulary for the proposals.
</p>

<h2>A cross-functional initiative to bring the vision to life</h2>
<p>
  At our vision's core was a stark simplification of the app's main map.
</p>
<p>
  Despite widespread support for it, the team was in no position to execute that simplification -- neither architecturally nor organizationally. 
</p>
<p>
  I proposed and then led an initiative to change that.
</p>

    To do this, I had to broker conversations between teams with competing short-term incentives, then present a unified plan
    to execs. Here's an example of how I did that (2021-22) &darr;

<!-- <h2>Going deep on the vision's most technical parts</h2>
<p>
  After laying the groundwork for a map redesign, I was tasked with taking the map vision even further.
</p>
<p>
  This gave me an opportunity to study cartography and data visualization in depth, and to build <a href="">new tooling</a> for map design.
  I was responsible for the basemap design and the data viz on top of it.
