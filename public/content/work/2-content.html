  In late 2022, I conceived and built a tool for Uber designers to work on cartography and geospatial visualizations in tandem. That tool helped me
  lead a redesign of the Uber driver/courier app's most used feature -- the main map -- from the ground up. The tooling I built sped up the redesign 
  while improving the quality of every stage of output.

  This infrastructure allowed me to explore more radical ideas faster, at high fidelity, with production code as a deliverable. The new design -- which was a
  collaboration with one other designer, who led the non-map UI -- completely reshaped the map into a stark canvas for data visualization. This launch is 
  still under development at Uber, but at the time I left, it had been presented company-wide and even in board meetings.
