<h1>Vision-setting and vision-enabling</h1>
<p>
  In 2021, I was one of two designers asked to lead a redesign of Uber's complex and cumbersome driver app.
</p>
<p>
  Despite internal support for our vision, at its core was a map overhaul that Uber was in no position to execute, either organizationally or architecturally.
</p>
<p>
  I proposed and led an initiative across teams to change that.
</p>

<h2>A cross-functional initiative to bring it to life</h2>
<p>
  To overhaul the map as we envisioned, many teams would need to collaborate on a tech migration with a new design.
</p>
<p>
  But the map had no clear owner to lead that collaboration -- surprisingly, since it's 75% of the app home screen.
</p>
<p>
  So I became its owner. I brokered conversations between teams with competing short-term incentives, presented to execs, and led those
  teams with a unified plan.
