    In 2021, I was one of two designers asked to lead a redesign of Uber's complex and cumbersome driver app. Despite internal support for our vision,
    at its core was a map overhaul that Uber was in no position to execute, either organizationally or architecturally. I proposed and led an org-wide
    initiative to change that. The initiative led to 10+ launches and a roadmap that enabled Uber to ship a new homescreen map in 2023.

  <p>
    To overhaul the map as we envisioned, many teams would need to collaborate on a tech migration and a new design. But the map had no clear 
    product owner to lead that collaboration -- surprisingly, since it's 75% of the app home screen. So I became its owner. I brokered conversations between 
    four teams with competing short-term incentives, presented to execs, and led those teams with a unified plan.

  <p>
    The results: within a few months, we had launched over a dozen small improvements to the map, accomplished the tech migration that made the new design possible,
    and ultimately started rolling out a totally new homescreen map concept in 2023.
