<h1>Rapid results on an aggressive timeline</h1>

<p>
  Uber drivers use the driver app's Activity Feed every day to review their recent trips and earnings.
</p>

<p>
  But its design buried that use case deep, forcing users to drill down into each individual receipt for the info they need.
</p>

<p>
  In 2020 I led a one-month rethink of the feature, which had a dramatic effect both on engagement (+41%) and on
  that painful drill-down behavior (&minus;38%).

  To meet our aggressive timeline, I worked directly with the VP of Driver and design leadership, instead of a conventional review process.
</p>

<p> 
  Meanwhile I worked with Engineering to ensure my UI framework would extend to the team's future plans. I also updated the Activity Feed's 
  visual language to Uber's then-new design system.
</p>

<p>
  The rapid progress motivated a central focus on Earnings UI in the team's 2021 roadmap.
